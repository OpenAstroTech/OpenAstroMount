# OpenAstroMount

![OAM](https://i.imgur.com/1LZaNa9.jpeg)

v1.0 released now! 

The OpenAstroMount is a mount meant for larger telescopes that the OpenAstroTracker can't handle. It's fairly heavy and bulky, but can pack quite some payload. It features build in autoPA through motorized ALT and AZ axis. Both RA and DEC are driven entirely by belts, resulting in extremely low backlash. On both axis there is a two-stage belted gearbox with a reduction of 9:1 which, in combination with the large RA and DEC wheels, gives a total reduction of 316:1 and 234:1 for RA and DEC respectively. 

Specs:

| Weight                             | Cost      | Payload | Performance (PHD2) |
|------------------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 12kg + tripod <br>& counterweights | ~300-500$ | 5+ kg*   | 0.5-0.7" RMS    |

`* since my heaviest gear weighs only about 4kg, i haven't tested the mount with more payload, hence the official payload recommendation remains 5kg. This will likely increase once the mount has been tested with more payload. `
